## Directory Structure and How to Start Learning

All the learning steps are organized under the `Modules` directory. Each directory contains a `README.md` file with detailed instructions and examples, and a `workspace/` subdirectory for test/implementation files.

1. **Introduction to Rust**: Start with the [`Introduction`](Modules/00-Introduction/README.md) to set up your environment and write your first Rust program.
2. **Getting Started**: Move on to [`Getting Started`](Modules/01-Getting-Started/README.md) to learn how to create and manage Rust projects using Cargo.
3. **Basic Concepts**: Learn the [`Basic Concepts`](Modules/02-Basic-Concepts/README.md) of Rust, including variables, data types, functions, and control flow.
4. **Ownership and Borrowing**: Understand Rust's unique [`Ownership and Borrowing`](Modules/03-Ownership-and-Borrowing/README.md) model.
5. **Structs and Enums**: Work with [`Structs and Enums`](Modules/04-Structs-and-Enums/README.md) to create custom data types.
6. **Error Handling**: Learn how to handle errors in Rust with the [`Error Handling`](Modules/05-Error-Handling/README.md) section.
7. **Collections**: Explore Rust's [`Collections`](Modules/06-Collections/README.md) like vectors and hash maps.
8. **Iterators and Closures**: Use [`Iterators and Closures`](Modules/07-Iterators-and-Closures/README.md) for more advanced data manipulation.
9. **Modules and Packages**: Organize your code with [`Modules and Packages`](Modules/08-Modules-and-Packages/README.md).
10. **Concurrency**: Write concurrent programs in Rust with the [`Concurrency`](Modules/09-Concurrency/README.md) section.
11. **Advanced Topics**: Dive into [`Advanced Topics`](Modules/10-Advanced-Topics/README.md) and best practices.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Rust: The easiest way to install Rust is by using `rustup`, the Rust toolchain installer. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```sh
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

- A Code Editor: While you can use any text editor, it's recommended to use an editor with Rust support. Some popular choices are:
    - Visual Studio Code with the Rust extension
    - IntelliJ IDEA with the Rust plugin
    - Sublime Text with Rust support
