> This content is under review and may contain inaccuracies. Feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Directory Structure

All the learning steps are organized under the `steps` directory:

- `steps/00-Introduction/`: Introduction to Rust and setting up the environment.
- `steps/01-Getting-Started/`: Writing your first Rust program.
- `steps/02-Basic-Concepts/`: Basic syntax and concepts in Rust.
- `steps/03-Ownership-and-Borrowing/`: Understanding Rust's ownership model.
- `steps/04-Structs-and-Enums/`: Working with structs and enums.
- `steps/05-Error-Handling/`: Handling errors in Rust.
- `steps/06-Collections/`: Using collections like vectors and hash maps.
- `steps/07-Iterators-and-Closures/`: Using iterators and closures.
- `steps/08-Modules-and-Packages/`: Organizing code with modules and packages.
- `steps/09-Concurrency/`: Writing concurrent programs in Rust.
- `steps/10-Advanced-Topics/`: Advanced topics and best practices.

Each directory contains a `README.md` file with detailed instructions and examples, and a `workspace/` subdirectory for test/implementation files.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Rust: The easiest way to install Rust is by using `rustup`, the Rust toolchain installer. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```sh
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

- A Code Editor: While you can use any text editor, it's recommended to use an editor with Rust support. Some popular choices are:
    - Visual Studio Code with the Rust extension
    - IntelliJ IDEA with the Rust plugin
    - Sublime Text with Rust support
